👋 Hi, I’m Beata - but you can call me Bea
🔍 Data Analyst with hands‑on experience across financial services, utilities, and consultancy
📊 Skilled in SQL, Power BI, DAX, Excel, and data modelling
🤖 Comfortable working with Python, machine learning fundamentals, and AI‑assisted analysis
🎨 Passionate about clear, accessible, colour‑blind‑friendly data visualisation
🚀 Driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and turning complex data into actionable insights

✨ 
I’m a detail‑oriented Data Analyst who enjoys transforming raw data into meaningful stories that support confident decision‑making. My experience spans financial services, consultancy, and utilities, where I’ve delivered MI reporting, built interactive Power BI dashboards, validated data across systems, and supported both internal and external stakeholders. I’ve worked closely with senior analysts, engineers, and business leaders, ensuring that insights are accurate, accessible, and aligned with organisational goals.

My background includes SQL Server querying, data cleaning, dashboard development, and implementing machine learning models such as linear regression. I’m also experienced in standardising reporting visuals and converting legacy reports into modern, user‑friendly dashboards.

I’m committed to continuous improvement — whether that’s deepening my technical skills, experimenting with AI tools, or refining my approach to user‑centric design. Outside of work, you’ll usually find me weightlifting or building Gundam models, both of which keep me focused and creative.
